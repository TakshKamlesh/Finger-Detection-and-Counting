## Finger-Detection-and-Counting
Using Opencv I have created a program which detects and counts the number of fingers in the hand currently appearing in the bounding box. Note that this algorithm does not use any deep learning techniques and relies on classic computer vision models.

# Dependencies
1.) OpenCV </br>
2.) Matplotlib </br>
3.) Numpy </br>
4.) Scikit-Learn </br>

If you are using python2, run python2.sh </br>
Else run python3.sh
